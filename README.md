# Metadata-Tabulation


People spend a lot of time doing manual data entries, so this project explores the possibility of making this task easier. <br>

While conducting Surveys generally, organizations share paper-based forms for filling up potential lead data, rather than using e-forms. <br>
This adds up to an overhead of manual data entries, thus this project aims at addressing how this overhead can be reduced to a certain extent.
##

In this project, we use Voice files as input, each voice file acts as a data entry. <br>
The Tabulation.py code inputs these voice files, processes them, and adds a row to the Excel sheet.
Likewise, it can process all the data entries in less time than the manual task.

Later on, if we want to convert this file to some other regional language for better understanding, Trasnlation.py does this job at its best.
For now, the target language in the code is set to Marathi, but it can be changed as needed.
